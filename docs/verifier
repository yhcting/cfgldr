Usage

* verify rule of config file.

Rules
-----
* Basic syntax is same with config-file-syntax

* Token is 'regular expression(regex)' without white-space.
  And, key value should be also regex-token.

* regex try to match whole word. That is,
  It is like leading '^' and trailing '$' are added automatically.
  So, leading '^' can be reserved for different usage (See 'prefix' part below)

* Rule is checked with order - from top to bottom.
  That is, first described rule is matched at first.
  If matching rule for key name is found, value-verifying is proceeded.
  If it fails, result is failure.
  NOTE that, verifier DOESN'T move to next rules to find another rule.

* special prefix character is used at key.
  '^': mandatory key (key that should be defined.)
       Mandatory property may be overwritten by property of inherited key.
       << example >>
       @inherit (verifier) # '^key = [a-z]+' is defined. 'key' is mandatory.
       key = [a-z]+        # Now, 'key' is NOT mandatory.

* special prefix character is used at key value.
  '^': following expression is NOT regex (special meaning)
       (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

  << example >>
  ^version = .*  # version is mandatory key.
  version = '=*' # =* is used as regex.
  version = '#+[a-b]*'
  [ sect\w+ ]
    @include (rule.01)
    ver[0-9] = [0-9]+
